# Neurohumanities Lab: Real-Time Emotion Detection

## Overview
Within the field of humanities, there is a recognized lack of educational innovation, as there are currently no reported tools available that enable individuals to interact with their environment to create an enhanced learning experience in the humanities. This project proposes a solution to address this gap by integrating technology and promoting the development of teaching methodologies in the humanities, specifically through the incorporation of emotional monitoring during the learning process. 

The main objective of this project is to develop a real-time emotion detection system utilizing EEG signals, which will be interpreted and classified into specific emotions. These emotions will be aligned with the ones proposed by Descartes, including admiration, love, hate, desire, joy, and sadness. By integrating emotional data into the Neurohumanities Lab interactive platform, the aim is to create a comprehensive and immersive learning environment.

## Features
- Real-time emotion detection using EEG signals
- Interpretation and classification of emotions (admiration, love, hate, desire, joy, sadness)
- Integration with the Neurohumanities Lab interactive platform

## Results
The algorithm developed for the Real-Time Emotion Detection achieved better results (92-93% accuracy) than the ones found in consulted literature (88% accuracy). The algorithm focuses on predicting the given emotions, and for further research, it is recommended to consider additional information.
