# Real-time EEG Emotion Classification

This project focuses on real-time EEG (Electroencephalography) emotion classification using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify emotional states based on EEG signals in real-time.

## Introduction

The field of Humanities lacks educational innovation, particularly in the absence of tools that enable individuals to interact with their environment and create an immersive learning experience. This project proposes the development of an immersive classroom equipped with an emotion detection module, aimed at enhancing the learning experience in humanities. Electroencephalogram (EEG) and other biometric devices, as well as Computer Vision techniques, will be utilized to capture signals from participants. The collected data will inform the development of proposals for improvement in the learning process.
   Over a 15-week period, the Neurohumanities Lab (NH Lab) undertook three distinct projects: Real-Time Emotion Detection, Movement Detection, and Brain Synchronization. The successful implementation of these projects relied on the utilization of the OpenBCI interface, depth sensing cameras and the Emp√°tica device. The outcomes of the research will be documented in a scientific article. The article aims to shed light on the potential benefits of the immersive approach in fostering enhanced emotional engagement and learning outcomes in the classroom setting.
